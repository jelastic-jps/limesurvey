# LimeSurvey

The package deploys the [LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/) solution - an open-source online statistical survey web application written in PHP. LimeSurvey provides tools to develop and publish simple, quick, and anonymous online surveys. Additionally, it enables users to collect responses, review statistics, and export the resulting data to other applications.


## Environment Topology

This package creates a dedicated LimeSurvey environment that contains one application server and one database container. It automatically deploys and sets the LimeSurvey application. The automatic vertical scaling is enabled out of the box, and [horizontal scaling](https://www.virtuozzo.com/application-platform-docs/automatic-horizontal-scaling/) can be configured (if needed). The default software stacks utilized in the package are the following:

- Apache 2 PHP application server (PHP 8.2)
- MySQL 8 database
- LimeSurvey 6.6.5
